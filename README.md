Script that automates the computer rename using Inventory Preload in Jamf

This script is intended for use only with Jamf Cloud and Inventory Preload, it will automate the computer rename process based on serial number and Extension Attributes.
The repo will help keeping track of the changes, issues and improvements.

Please keep in mind that I'm not an expert developer so it may not be perfect, any suggestion is appreciated.
